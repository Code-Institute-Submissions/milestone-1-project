# **User Centric Front-End Development Milestone Project**

# *Irish Drone Club*

## **The project idea is of a website for drone enthusiasts**

>The purpose of the website is to let people who are interested in flying drones and photographers who like to use drones, to come together to collaborate and enjoy flying their drones at locations in Ireland.  The website will present videos from YouTube, and still images of drones. 
The page is made up of the following pages, using semantic HTML5 and will use a Bootstrap grid layout which will transition for a mobile first design.

# *Design brief:*

>This project is about creating a basic website that incorporates many of the elements learned in this section.

>Common sections to all the remaining pages:
Structure will be a bootstrap grid.  I used as site called [Shoelace - Visual Bootstrap 3 Grid Builder](http://shoelace.io) to help me plan the grid for desk top then to see what the mobile approach may look like.

| Area             | Grid Sizing |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| Nav bar          | col-sm-12   |
| Header           | col-sm-12   |
| Section, Article | col-sm-8    |
| Section, Asside  | col-md-4    |
| Footer, Meetups  | col-sm-8    |
| Footer, Socials  | col sm-4    |

## Additional Site information:

>There will need to be a member sign in section as well as a new member sign up form. There will also need to be a form where members a post links to their YouTube video files so that they can be reviewed for posting to this site.

## Mobile & Desktop Navigation

>On mobile devices, the navigation bar compresses to reveal a compressed hamburger navigation icon on the right. The mobile menu will drop down from the top left corner of the navigation bar.  I plan to use hover effects on the items as well as delayed transitions to improve the UX. Where there is opportunity, I will also use Font Awesome icons to enhance the metaphorical imagery to better link the textual narratives to the page imagery.

### Landing Page:

>A hero image fills the page.  There is a compressed hamburger navigation icon in the top right corner of the page, that lets users enter the different sections of the site. The image will be vertically centred and have the full view height and be fixed absolute for smaller screens. Over the top of the image there will be a transparent nav bar with a compressed hamburger nav icon that will allow the user to navigate further into the site. The nav menu will have drill-down properties and hover effects to show successful clicks.  Below the hero image, is a transparent footer which will contain the social links to the site.

### First Page:

>The site lets them showcase a feature video of the month, filmed from a drone.  There may be several other videos from previous months that a user can select and play. The article section will contain a video player window from YouTube which will fill the area: col-sm-8.  Beside this is the aside with textual contend containing discussion and a link to the video being sown in the article.

The image the article section will have an image container displaying 4 images, col-sm-8 col-md-2, col-md-2, col-md-2, col-md-2.

### Third Page:

>This section of the web page is divided into four sections, the header, article and aside and footer.  My initial design is to use a google map with location pins in the article. The Aside will have meetup information and possibly a calendar entry system so that users can update their drone flight diary.
